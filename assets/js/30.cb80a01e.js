However, the non-independently and identically distribution (i.e., Non-IID) characteristic of different image domains among different clients reduces the benefits of federated learning and has become a bottleneck problem restricting the accuracy and generalization of federated models. In this work, we propose a novel federated image segmentation method based on style transfer, FedST, by using a denoising diffusion probabilistic model to achieve feature disentanglement and image synthesis of cross-domain image data between multiple clients. Thus it can share style features among clients while protecting structure features of image data, which effectively alleviates the influence of the Non-IID phenomenon.

Our proposed method includes two modules, R-D and D-R, which generate more concealed adversarial point cloud samples by modifying digital and physical features. The R-D module maps real-world entities to point cloud data in the digital world and generates adversarial samples by modifying signal amplitude values. The D-R module constructs adversarial objects by modifying the surface diffuse reflectance of the target object based on ray tracing and correspondences between digital and physical features.

Deep learning has been an important method for HRRP target recognition. However, recent research has shown that optical image target recognition methods based on deep learning are vulnerable to adversarial samples. Whether HRRP target recognition methods based on deep learning can be attacked remains an open question. In this paper, four methods of generating adversarial perturbations are proposed. Algorithm 1 generates the nontargeted fine-grained perturbation based on the binary search method. Algorithm 2 generates the targeted fine-grained perturbation based on the multiple-iteration method. Algorithm 3 generates the nontargeted universal adversarial perturbation (UAP) based on aggregating some fine-grained perturbations. Algorithm 4 generates the targeted universal perturbation based on scaling one fine-grained perturbation. These perturbations are used to generate adversarial samples to attack HRRP target recognition methods based on deep learning under white-box and black-box attacks. The experiments are conducted with actual radar data and show that the HRRP adversarial samples have certain aggressiveness. Therefore, HRRP target recognition methods based on deep learning have potential security risks.")]),e._v(" "),t("p",[e._v("Huang T, "),t("em",[t("strong",[e._v("Chen Y")])]),e._v(", Yao B, et al.
